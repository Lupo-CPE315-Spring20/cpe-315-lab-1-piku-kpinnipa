# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Things to include in your README

* Kiran Pinnipati.
* Status of your lab
  * Complete.
  * Should work, I hope.
* Compilation and execution instructions
  * `gcc -o piku piku.s`
  * `./piku`
* Issues that you encountered along the way, and anything you have questions about.
    No issues in particular. Haven't been able to test file because of access issues with raspberry pi server. Hopefully should work though. Will try to test again later and see.
These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
